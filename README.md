# Let's Quibble

The *original* Quibble, free to play and combines the word-building of Scr\*bble with the excitement and deep satisfaction of capturing your opponent's tiles and points. Capture tiles by building new words; adding prefixes, suffixes, intersections and adjacencies (see the Scr\*bble documentation for building new words). 
 
No hidden costs, no ads, no tokens. Accept no substitutes and beware sound-alikes!
